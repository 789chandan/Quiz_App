                    <h2>Introduction to DSA</h2>
                    <h5>Posted by techboychandan</h5>
                    <p>Data structures and algorithms (DSA) are the core of computer science and programming. They are
                        the tools that enable us to store, manipulate, and process data efficiently and effectively. In
                        this blog, we will explore various topics related to DSA, such as arrays, lists, stacks, queues,
                        trees, graphs, sorting, searching, hashing, recursion, dynamic programming, and more. We will
                        also learn how to implement and analyze DSA using different programming languages, such as C,
                        C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript.</p>

                    <h2>Array and Lists</h2>
                    <h5>Posted by techboychandan</h5>
                    <p>Arrays and lists are two of the most basic and common data structures in computer science. They
                        are both linear data structures, meaning that they store data in a sequential order. However,
                        they have different properties and operations that make them suitable for different scenarios.
                        In this post, we will compare and contrast arrays and lists, and see how to implement and use
                        them in different programming languages.</p>

                    <h2>Graph and Tree</h2>
                    <h5>Posted by techboychandan</h5>
                    <p>A graph and a tree are both non-linear data structures that store data in the form of nodes and
                        edges. However, they have some differences in their properties and applications. Here are some
                        of the main differences between a graph and a tree:

                        A graph can be connected or disconnected, can have cycles or loops, and does not necessarily
                        have a root node. A tree is a type of graph that is connected, acyclic (meaning it has no cycles
                        or loops), and has a single root node.
                        A graph can have directed or undirected edges, meaning that the edges have a specific direction
                        or they do not. A tree always has directed edges, from the parent node to the child node.
                        A graph can have multiple paths between any two nodes, while a tree has a unique path between
                        any two nodes.
                        A graph can have weighted edges, where each edge has a weight or cost associated with it. A tree
                        does not have weighted edges, unless it is a special type of tree, such as a binary search tree.
                        A graph can have any number of edges, while a tree has a fixed number of edges, which is one
                        less than the number of nodes.</p>

                    <h2>Stack and Queue</h2>
                    <h5>Posted by techboychandan</h5>
                    <p>
                        Stack and queue are two fundamental data structures in computer science. A stack is a linear
                        data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle, meaning that the last
                        element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. A queue, on the other hand, follows
                        the FIFO (First In First Out) principle, meaning that the first element added to the queue is
                        the first one to be removed.
